Keep synchronous local commits consistent with concurrent session reconciliation by yielding only between complete SQLite/model steps. Preserve local edits, journal entries and persisted heads during rebases, invalidate cached reads after rollback, and reject terminal admission before materialization. Subscribers may observe complete intermediate prefixes of large upstream batches. Related synchronous-commit coordination issue: https://github.com/livestorejs/livestore/issues/1465.
