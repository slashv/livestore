# LiveStore — Ontology

## Language

- **Event** — An immutable record of a domain fact, committed to a store and
  appended to its eventlog. Every event is either synced or client-only.
- **Event definition** — The schema declaring an event type: name, payload
  schema, sync scope, and associated materializer.
- **Synced event** — An event distributed to other clients of the same store
  via the sync backend.
- **Client-only event** — An event that stays on the committing client and is
  never pushed upstream.
- **Eventlog** — The append-only, totally ordered log of committed events for
  one store; the source of truth all state derives from.
- **Event sequence number** — The composite position of an event in the
  eventlog: global part, client part, and rebase generation.
- **Rebase generation** — The component of an event sequence number that
  increments each time pending events are rebased; the leader rejects pushes
  carrying an older generation.
- **Pending event** — An event committed locally but not yet confirmed by
  the sync backend.
- **Upstream head** — The latest backend-confirmed eventlog position
  (persisted leader-side as `backendHead`).
- **Local head** — The latest locally committed eventlog position, including
  pending events.
- **Derived event** — A framework-generated event with an implicit
  materializer (e.g. client-document set events); never user-defined.
- **Schema hash** — A deterministic schema identifier used for drift
  detection. State schemas use a LiveStore-owned storage fingerprint; event
  definitions use their Effect schema hash.
- **Storage format version** — The manually bumped version of persisted
  eventlog/state formats (`liveStoreStorageFormatVersion`); incompatible
  bumps reset persistence.
- **Materializer** — A pure function of an event and current state, producing
  state changes; runs identically on every client. _Avoid:_ projector, event
  handler.
- **Materialization journal** — The per-event record of how materialization
  changed state (a SQLite session changeset, or none), kept until the event is
  confirmed so rebase can roll state back. _Avoid:_ session changeset table.
- **State** — Data derived from the eventlog via materializers and queryable
  by the app. "Read model" is the event-sourcing literature term for the same
  thing; State is canonical in LiveStore.
- **Client document** — A keyed document table shape for client-local/UI
  state with last-write-wins semantics, built on the SQLite state
  realization.
- **Store** — The app-facing entry point bundling eventlog, state, and
  reactivity for one `storeId`.
- **storeId** — The identifier that partitions data and sync scope; one
  eventlog exists per `storeId`.
- **Client** — A logical group of client sessions on one device/runtime that
  share local data; identified by `clientId`.
- **Client session** — One running instance within a client (e.g. a browser
  tab); identified by `sessionId`; hosts a store and its reactivity graph.
- **Leader thread** — The per-client role that owns persistence and sync;
  exactly one leader is active per client at a time.
- **Adapter (platform adapter)** — The realization of the runtime contract
  for one platform (web, Cloudflare, Node, Expo, …); instantiates client
  sessions and the leader.
- **Sync provider** — A package providing a sync backend plus the client
  transport to reach it.
- **Sync backend** — The central service that orders and distributes synced
  events for a `storeId`.
- **Sync processor** — The component reconciling local pending events with
  upstream events; one runs session-side and one leader-side.
- **Owner (sync processor)** — The only code allowed to change a sync
  processor's model: the leader's mailbox loop, or the session's synchronous
  `owned` body. _Avoid:_ lock holder.
- **`LeaderMessage`** — A tagged input to the leader sync processor's mailbox
  (local push, backend page, push/pull result, retry, shutdown), handled one at
  a time. _Avoid:_ unqualified "message" (collides with wire-protocol and
  devtools messages).
- **`SessionMessage`** — A tagged input that changes the session sync
  processor's model without returning a result to its sender. _Avoid:_
  unqualified "message".
- **Runner (sync processor)** — The session sync processor's asynchronous
  side: it does all waiting (leader push, cancellation, refresh, yield,
  shutdown) and reports outcomes back to the owner as `SessionMessage`s.
- **Job (sync processor)** — A unit of work the session owner hands to the
  runner (`Push`, `Reconcile`, `BeginShutdown`, `FinishShutdown`,
  `NotifyFailure`).
- **Outbox (sync processor)** — Where the session owner holds jobs and
  notifications during a transition; delivered after the owner is released,
  dropped if the transition fails.
- **`LeaderPersistence`** — The leader's durable seam: rollback,
  materialization, eventlog writes, journal maintenance, and heads, committed
  as coordinated state and eventlog transactions.
- **Persist receipt** — What a successful `LeaderPersistence` call returns:
  the persisted events, their materializer hashes, and the resulting heads.
  The leader publishes and acknowledges only what a receipt reports.
- **Rebase** — Re-parenting local pending events onto newly pulled upstream
  events, incrementing their rebase generation.
- **Live query** — A reactive query over state (`queryDb`, `computed`,
  `signal`) that recomputes when its inputs change.
- **Query definition** — The hash-keyed blueprint of a live query; equal
  definitions share one query instance.
- **Query instance** — A live, reference-counted node in the reactivity
  graph, created from a query definition.
- **Result cache** — The bounded SQL-result cache keyed by statement and
  bind values, invalidated per written table and cleared on rollback;
  distinct from query-instance dedup.
- **Reactivity graph** — The incremental computation graph that propagates
  state changes to live queries.
- **Store registry** — The `storeId`-keyed manager of store lifecycles:
  load, reuse, eviction.
- **Fast path** — The session-boot shortcut that reads the persisted state
  DB directly instead of requesting a snapshot from the leader.
- **Boot status** — The staged boot progress surface
  (loading → migrating → rehydrating → syncing → done).
- **Termination lock** — A steal-mode Web Lock held by the shared worker;
  its release signals worker death.
- **Mesh node** — A named participant in the webmesh transport, connected to
  peers by edges and communicating over channels.
- **Direct channel** — A webmesh channel over a negotiated `MessagePort`;
  no per-message acknowledgements.
- **Proxy channel** — A hop-routed webmesh channel in which every payload is
  individually acknowledged.
- **Broadcast channel** — A fan-out webmesh channel without
  acknowledgements or buffering for late joiners.
- **Devtools** — The tooling surface for inspecting eventlog, state, and sync
  status, connected via the devtools protocol.
- **Devtools protocol version** — The integer handshake version that decides
  devtools compatibility; the package version is display-only.
- **SessionInfo** — The periodic identity announcement devtools use to
  discover live client sessions.
- **Introspection surface** — Devtools' direct inspection surface (debug
  info, graph snapshots), parallel to and currently independent of OTel
  telemetry. _Avoid:_ introspection channel (not a webmesh channel).
- **Control operation** — A devtools message that mutates engine state
  (reset, import, event injection) rather than inspecting it.
- **Changeset (SQLite session)** — A SQLite session-extension changeset
  captured per materialization; the payload of a materialization journal
  record, inverted to roll back state during rebase.
- **Changeset (release)** — A pnpm changeset file describing a package-level
  change, folded into release notes.
- **BDFL** — Benevolent Dictator For Life: the project creator holds final
  decision authority; governance detail in `05-contributing/`.
- **Facts** _(experimental)_ — Declarative constraints an event sets,
  unsets, requires, or reads; input to ordering, compaction, and conflict
  detection.
## Structure

The **event** is the spine: every other concept produces events, orders
them, derives from them, or observes the result.

| Relation to the spine | Terms |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Produce | Store (commit), Client session |
| Order | Eventlog, Event sequence number, Sync backend, Rebase, Facts _(experimental)_ |
| Derive | Materializer, State, Client document |
| Observe | Live query, Reactivity graph, Devtools |

### Term families and leitwörter

Families group terms around an anchor; followers carry the anchor's leitwort
in their name:

- **Event family** (leitwort "event") — anchor **Event**; followers Event
  definition, Eventlog, Event sequence number, Synced event, Client-only
  event, Pending event, Derived event.
- **Client family** (leitwort "client") — anchor **Client**; followers
  Client session, Client document.
- **Sync family** (leitwort "sync") — no single anchor noun; Sync provider,
  Sync backend, Sync processor share the leitwort. Rebase, Rebase
  generation, Upstream head, and Local head are its operation/position
  vocabulary (no leitwort — they name acts and places, not sync parts).
  Owner, Runner, Job, Outbox, `LeaderMessage`, `SessionMessage`,
  `LeaderPersistence`, and Persist receipt are Sync processor's internal
  vocabulary; generic nouns carry the "(sync processor)" qualifier, and code
  names stay qualified rather than shortened to "message".
- **State family** — anchor **State**; Materializer, Materialization
  journal, Changeset (SQLite session), Schema hash, and Storage format version
  are its derivation and versioning vocabulary (mechanism names, no shared leitwort).
- **Store family** (leitwort "store") — anchor **Store**; followers storeId,
  Store registry. Live query, Query definition, Query instance, Result
  cache, and Reactivity graph are its observation vocabulary.
- **Channel family** (leitwort "channel") — webmesh transport channels:
  Direct channel, Proxy channel, Broadcast channel; Mesh node is the
  participant term.
- **Devtools family** (leitwort "devtools") — anchor **Devtools**; follower
  Devtools protocol version. SessionInfo, Introspection surface, and
  Control operation are its discovery/inspection vocabulary.

### Naming rubric

- A new term that follows an existing anchor joins that family and carries
  its leitwort (e.g. anything scoped to one event starts with "event").
- A compound touching two families is named by its primary anchor ("Sync
  processor" is sync-family even though it moves events).
- A term enters the Language layer before specs may use it.

### Other relations

- **Derivation chain:** Event definition → Event → Eventlog → Materializer →
  State → Live query → App.
- **Containment:** A Client contains one or more Client sessions plus the
  Leader role; sessions reach the leader through a proxy.
- **Pluggable dimensions:** Adapter, Sync provider, Framework integration,
  State realization, Devtools surface — each is a contract with multiple
  realizations.
