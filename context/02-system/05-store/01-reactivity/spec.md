# Reactivity — Spec

This document specifies the reactivity graph, the live-query kinds, and the
dedup/caching layers (`packages/@livestore/livestore/src/{reactive.ts,
live-queries/,QueryCache.ts,SqliteDbWrapper.ts}`). It builds on
[requirements.md](./requirements.md).

## Status

Draft.

## Scope

Defines: graph update guarantees, query-kind semantics, identity/dedup
rules, the caching substrate. Does not define: the Store surface and commit
path ([../spec.md](../spec.md)), state materialization
(`../../02-state/`).

## Graph Update Guarantees

`reactive.ts` implements a signals-based incremental graph
(Adapton-inspired, eager — lazy recomputation deliberately not
implemented):

- **Synchronous and eager:** a ref update refreshes the graph before
  `setRef(s)` returns; there is no scheduler or microtask deferral.
- **Atomic per commit:** one commit sets all written table refs in a single
  `setRefs` batch, producing exactly one refresh pass regardless of how many
  tables the events touched.
- **Glitch-free:** refresh proceeds in topological sort order (heights
  maintained eagerly as edges change), so a node never observes a mix of
  old and new inputs.
- **Equality cutoff:** each thunk compares against its previous result and
  stops propagation when equal. Db queries use an eagerly-built
  `Schema.toEquivalence`; supplying `map` disables the equivalence, so
  mapped queries always re-propagate (`db-query.ts:332-346`;
  LS.SYS.STORE.RX-R05).
- **Opt-out:** `commit({ skipRefresh: true }, …)` defers the refresh to a
  later manual refresh / `runDeferredEffects` pass; subscriber effects run
  through the adapter-provided `batchUpdates` wrapper.

## Query Kinds

| Kind | Constructor | Identity (`def.hash`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Db query | `queryDb()` | `queryString + deps + extraDeps` | `SessionIdSymbol` serialized as the literal `'SessionIdSymbol'` so identity stays session-agnostic |
| Computed | `computed()` | `deps` if given, else `fn.toString()` | Referential result equality only (no schema equivalence) |
| Signal | `signal()` | `nanoid()` | Every call is unique — signals never dedup; `set` takes a plain value (functional update resolved by `store.setSignal`) |
| Client document | `table.get(id)` backing query | RowQuery label `${table}.get:${id}` | First read seeds the default row via `store.commit(table.set(...))` with `skipRefresh: true` to avoid a reactive loop during render |

Db queries are two thunks: `queryInput$` builds the SQL and tracks
dependencies (its equality compares query text + `deepEqual(bindValues)`;
the result schema is deliberately not compared), and `results$` executes and
decodes. Reactivity comes from `get(tableRef)` dependencies on the queried
tables — query-builder queries set a single table eagerly; raw-SQL/function
queries resolve tables lazily via `getTablesUsed`
(`db-query.ts:252,378-393`).

Contextual (function-form) db queries whose builder is not introspectable on
Hermes (Expo) must supply explicit `deps` or construction throws
(`db-query.ts:115`, `base-class.ts:104-125`; LS.SYS.STORE.RX-R04).

Query instances expose debug fields: `runs` (recomputation count; always `0`
for signals, whose `results$` is a ref, not a thunk), `executionTimes`,
`activeSubscriptions` (stack-info provenance), `isDestroyed`, monotonic
`id`.

Known limitation: `dependencyQueriesRef` is append-only across runs — a
dynamic query whose dependencies change keeps earlier dep instances
ref-counted until the query is destroyed (`base-class.ts:329` TODO).

### Extension: query surfaces

The built-in kinds above are not a closed set. A **query surface** is a
realization that adds a new live-query kind — a different query language over
the same session state — that joins the reactive graph, dedup, and equality
cutoff exactly like the built-ins (LS.SYS.STORE.RX-R02), so a query language can
be layered on without touching the engine. Realizations are listed in
[realizations.md](./realizations.md); contrib's GraphQL surface is the first.

## Identity and Dedup — Two Independent Layers

The current-layer distinction (LS.SYS.STORE.RX-R03; previously conflated in
this tree):

1. **Instance dedup** (`defRcMap`, `base-class.ts:345-373`): live-query
   instances are shared by `def.hash` with reference counting; `deref()` at
   zero destroys the instance. Signals opt out by construction (nanoid
   hash).
2. **SQL result cache** (`QueryCache.ts`): an LRU (200 entries) keyed on
   SQL text + bind values, invalidated per written table on
   `cachedExecute`. `ROLLBACK` (including `ROLLBACK TO` a savepoint) and
   changeset apply clear the whole cache, since neither reports which tables
   it touched; other transaction-control statements are ignored. This caches
   *values*, not reactivity — a hot table with >200 distinct queries evicts
   silently (flagged as provisional in code comments).

## Caching Substrate (`SqliteDbWrapper`)

Wraps the session SQLite with: a prepared-statement cache (200,
finalize-on-evict), `getTablesUsed` via SQLite's `tables_used()` virtual
table (with a special case for plain `DELETE FROM x`, which `tables_used()`
mishandles), and the result cache above. Write tracking here only
invalidates cached values; the refresh that re-runs live queries is driven
separately by the store bumping `tableRefs`. `getTablesUsed` is the shared
primitive feeding both mechanisms.

The Store hands the SQLite state services (`StateSqliteDb`, hence
`MaterializationJournal` and `StateHead`; see
[`02-state/01-sqlite`](../../02-state/01-sqlite/spec.md)) the wrapper's
`serviceDb` view of the same connection (`store/store.ts`). That view skips the
wrapper's spans, since the services trace their own statements, but its writes,
rollbacks and changeset applies still pass through the result cache, so journal
rollback during rebase cannot leave stale cached reads.
