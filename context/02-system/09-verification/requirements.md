# Verification — Requirements

Defines how LiveStore proves its own contracts: test lanes, conformance
suites for the pluggable dimensions, performance evidence, protocol
compatibility, determinism guards, and reproducible system-wide scenarios.
Refines the root's correctness and evidence criteria (notably [LS-R03],
[LS-R05], [LS-R06], [LS-R08], [LS-R10], [LS-R13], and [LS-R14]; vision
success criterion 6).

## Context

Builds on [../requirements.md](../requirements.md) (`LS.SYS-*`). CI
mechanics (runners, workflows) are owned by `../../03-delivery/`; this node
owns what is verified and by what kind of evidence.

## Requirements

- **LS.SYS.VER-R07 Traceability annotations:** Test files declare which
  intent-layer requirements they evidence via a `Verifies:` comment line
  listing `LS.*` IDs (format and honesty rule in
  [spec.md](./spec.md) §Traceability Annotations); annotations are
  comments only and never alter test behavior. Adopted 2026-07-16
  (interview).

Lane/dimension requirements live in the child nodes; the former
`LS.SYS.VER-R01…R06` were re-homed on 2026-07-16:

| Child | Owns | Re-homed IDs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [01-lanes/](./01-lanes/requirements.md) | Lane taxonomy, local/CI invocation | R01 → `LS.SYS.VER.LANE-R01` |
| [02-conformance/](./02-conformance/requirements.md) | Dimension conformance suites | R02 → `LS.SYS.VER.CONF-R01`, R03 → `LS.SYS.VER.CONF-R02` |
| [03-performance/](./03-performance/requirements.md) | Perf evidence | R04 → `LS.SYS.VER.PERF-R01` |
| [04-protocol-compat/](./04-protocol-compat/requirements.md) | Protocol compat tests | R05 → `LS.SYS.VER.PROTO-R01` |
| [05-determinism/](./05-determinism/requirements.md) | Determinism guards | R06 → `LS.SYS.VER.DET-R01` |

Reproducible composed-system evidence is owned by
[06-scenarios/](./06-scenarios/requirements.md), introduced by RFC 0003 under
the `LS.SYS.VER.SCEN-*` namespace.
