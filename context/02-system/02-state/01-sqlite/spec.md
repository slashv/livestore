# SQLite State Realization — Spec

This document specifies the SQLite realization of the state contract. It
builds on [requirements.md](./requirements.md) and the parent
[state spec](../spec.md) for the mechanism-agnostic pipeline. Why SQLite is
the primary read-model realization (and why the dimension stays open) is
recorded in
[.decisions/0001](./.decisions/0001-sqlite-primary-read-model.md).

## Status

Draft.

## Table DSL

```ts
const todos = State.SQLite.table({
  name: 'todos',
  columns: {
    id: State.SQLite.text({ primaryKey: true }),
    text: State.SQLite.text(),
    completed: State.SQLite.boolean({ default: false }),
  },
})
```

`table-def.ts` / `column-def.ts` / `column-spec.ts` build a SQLite AST
(`db-schema/`) from which DDL, row schemas, and the query-builder types are
derived (LS.SYS.STATE.SQLITE-R01). Column annotations carry
schema-level metadata. Without an explicit column-type annotation, inference
uses the schema's encoded shape: Date codecs encoded as milliseconds map to
`INTEGER`, including when refined with additional checks, while `Uint8Array`
codecs map to `BLOB`, also when refined. The inferred column retains the
original schema so those refinements continue to validate values decoded from
SQLite.

## Query Builder

`query-builder/` (`api.ts`, `astToSql.ts`) provides a deliberately small
SQL subset over table defs — reads: `select`, `where`, `orderBy`, `offset`,
`limit`, `first`, `count`, `row`; writes: `insert`, `update`, `delete` with
`onConflict` and `returning`. No joins, subqueries, or aggregations beyond
`count` — raw SQL (with bind values) is the escape hatch for those. Results
decode through the row schema derived from the table AST. Every builder
query carries its `writeTables`/`usedTables`, which feed both the query
hash used for live-query dedup and reactive invalidation
(`05-store/01-reactivity/`). Materializers may return query-builder writes,
raw SQL strings, or `{sql, bindValues, writeTables}`
(LS.SYS.STATE.SQLITE-R02).

## Client Documents

`client-document-def.ts`: a keyed document table where `set(value, id?)`
emits an auto-generated derived client-only event with an implicit
materializer; `get(id?)` is a typed query. Mechanics:

- The set-event payload is always `{ id, value }`; with
  `partialSet: true` (default, struct-valued documents only) `value` may be
  a partial that merges into the current document; otherwise the
  materializer upserts the full value via
  `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE` (`client-document-def.ts:305-321`)
  — last-write-wins per key (LS.SYS.STATE.SQLITE-R07).
- The `value` column stores full documents decoded through an
  _optimistic_ schema (`client-document-def.ts:66`) so historical value
  formats remain readable after the document schema evolves.
- `SessionIdSymbol` keys the document to the current session and is
  resolved before materialization (materializing an unresolved symbol is a
  defect).
- Scope: reaches all sessions of the client, never other clients. Caveat
  (from code): incompatible re-definitions of a client-document table can
  orphan old auto-generated events — rebuilds then lose that document
  state.

## System Tables

| Group                   | Tables                                                                    | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Eventlog                | `eventlog` (`eventlog-tables.ts`)                                         | one row per event: composite seqNum triple (PK) + parent triple, `name`, `argsJson`, `clientId`, `sessionId`, per-row `schemaHash`, `syncMetadataJson`; indexed on seqNum                                                                                     |

| Schema meta             | `__livestore_schema`, `__livestore_schema_event_defs` (`state-tables.ts`) | table-AST and event-definition hashes for drift detection                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Materialization journal | `__livestore_materialization_journal` (`state-tables.ts`)                 | one record per materialized event, keyed by the full seqNum triple: the SQLite session changeset, or `null` when materialization changed nothing.

| State head              | `__livestore_state_head` (`state-tables.ts`)                              | single row: the latest event sequence number the state DB reflects. Kept apart from the journal, whose records are pruned                                                                                                                                     |

(LS.SYS.STATE.SQLITE-R04.) Note the eventlog and the journal span two
databases: journal and head rows live in the _state_ DB while event rows live
in the _eventlog_ DB. Rebase rollback touches both (journal rollback, then
eventlog deletion); no read joins across them.

## SQLite Services

Leader and client-session code reach these databases through four Effect
services (`packages/@livestore/common/src/`):

| Service                                                | Role                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `StateSqliteDb` (`StateSqliteDb.ts`)                   | the state DB under a role-specific service identity                               |
| `EventlogSqliteDb` (`EventlogSqliteDb.ts`)             | the eventlog DB under a role-specific service identity                            |
| `StateHead` (`StateHead.ts`)                           | `get`/`set` for `__livestore_state_head`; `get` returns `ROOT` when no row exists |
| `MaterializationJournal` (`MaterializationJournal.ts`) | `record`, `rollback`, `discardUpTo` over `__livestore_materialization_journal`    |

`StateHead` and `MaterializationJournal` are built on `StateSqliteDb`; every
materialization writes its journal record and the state head next to its state
rows. On the leader the three commit in one state-DB savepoint
(`materialize-event.ts`). Journal semantics:

- `record` replaces any record at the same key. Events whose definition is
  unknown are recorded with a `null` changeset.
- `rollback(keys)` runs in one savepoint: it fails with
  `MaterializationJournalError` and leaves state unchanged if any key has no
  record, applies inverse changesets newest-first, then deletes the records.
- `discardUpTo(key)` deletes records at or below `(global, client)` regardless
  of rebase generation, once those events are confirmed upstream.

The client session records an entry for every committed and replayed event,
so `record` is on the commit path: a savepoint, a delete of any record at the
key, and an insert. It is most of what a session commit costs beyond `main`'s
in-memory changesets (in a 400-commit loop, a no-op `record` matched `main`'s
time). Possible follow-up improvements:

- Give the journal table a primary key on the sequence-number triple (the
  table definition still carries a TODO for it). `record` could then be one
  `INSERT OR REPLACE`, without the delete and its savepoint. The key changes
  state-DB layout, so it is cheapest while this release already rebuilds state
  for the renamed table.
- Savepoint names are unique per use (`SqliteDbHelper.withSavepoint`), so the
  Store runs each savepoint statement uncached. A reused name would make them
  cacheable, but only if every savepoint stays strictly nested.
- `discardUpTo` interpolates its key into the SQL, so each call prepares a new
  statement; bound parameters would make it reusable.
- Each journal statement creates an Effect span through `execSqlPrepared` or
  `execSql`; the hot journal writes could skip per-statement spans.

The client session's Store provides `StateSqliteDb` from its cache-aware
wrapper rather than the raw connection
(`../../05-store/01-reactivity/spec.md`).

## Schema Change

Owned by [02-schema-management](./02-schema-management/spec.md): hash-based
rebuild via adapter file naming, automatic migration hooks (contracted by
LS.SYS.STATE.SQLITE-R08), and the state-vs-eventlog versioning asymmetry.
