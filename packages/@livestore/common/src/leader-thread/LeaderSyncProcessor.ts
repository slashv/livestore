/**
 * The LeaderSyncProcessor manages synchronization of events between
 * the local state and the sync backend, ensuring efficient and orderly processing.
 *
 * In the LeaderSyncProcessor, pulling always has precedence over pushing.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Queueing incoming local events in a localPushesQueue.
 * - Broadcasting events to client sessions via pull queues.
 * - Pushing events to the sync backend.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * local push processing:
 * - localPushesQueue:
 *   - Maintains events in ascending order.
 *   - Uses `Deferred` objects to resolve/reject events based on application success.
 * - Processes events from the queue, applying events in batches.
 * - Controlled by a mutex (`Semaphore(1)`) to ensure mutual exclusion between local push and backend pull processing.
 * - The backend pull side acquires the mutex before processing and releases it on post-pull completion.
 * - Processes up to `maxBatchSize` events per cycle.
 *
 * Currently, we're advancing the state db and eventlog in lockstep, but we could also decouple this in the future
 *
 * Tricky concurrency scenarios:
 * - Queued local push batches becoming invalid due to a prior local push item being rejected.
 *   Solution: Introduce a generation number for local push batches which is used to filter out old batches items in case of rejection.
 *
 * See ClientSessionSyncProcessor for how the leader and session sync processors are similar/different.
